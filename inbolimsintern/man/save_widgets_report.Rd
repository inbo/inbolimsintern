\title{Save HTML Widget Report with Pandoc Detection}
\usage{
save_widgets_report(widget, filename = "output.html", libdir = "output_files")
}
\arguments{
\item{widget}{An HTML widget object to be saved (e.g., plotly, DT, leaflet)}

\item{filename}{Character string specifying the output filename.
Default is "output.html"}

\item{libdir}{Character string specifying the directory name for external
library files when creating non-self-contained HTML. Default is "output_files"}
}
\value{
NULL (invisible). The function is called for its side effects of
  creating HTML files and printing status messages.
}
\description{
This function saves an HTML widget to a file, automatically detecting whether
Pandoc is available and choosing the appropriate saving method. If Pandoc is
found and functional, it creates a self-contained HTML file. Otherwise, it
falls back to creating a non-self-contained HTML file with external dependencies.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
  \item Checks for Pandoc availability using \code{rmarkdown::find_pandoc()}
        and \code{Sys.which("pandoc")}
  \item If Pandoc is found, attempts to create a self-contained HTML file
        using \code{htmlwidgets::saveWidget()} with \code{selfcontained = TRUE}
  \item If Pandoc is not found or fails to run, falls back to creating a
        non-self-contained HTML file with external dependencies stored in
        the specified \code{libdir}
  \item Provides informative messages about the chosen method and any
        additional steps required for sharing the files
}

Self-contained HTML files include all CSS and JavaScript dependencies inline,
making them easier to share as a single file. Non-self-contained files require
the accompanying library directory to function properly.
}
\note{
When creating non-self-contained HTML files, ensure that the \code{libdir}
folder is included when sharing or deploying the HTML file, as it contains
necessary CSS and JavaScript dependencies.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Save a plotly widget as self-contained HTML (if Pandoc available)
library(plotly)
p <- plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg, type = "scatter", mode = "markers")
save_widgets_report(p, "my_plot.html")

# Save with custom library directory
save_widgets_report(p, "report.html", libdir = "assets")

# Save a DT datatable
library(DT)
dt <- datatable(iris)
save_widgets_report(dt, "data_table.html")
}
